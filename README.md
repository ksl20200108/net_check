# How to start?

1. Each miner should create their own wallet first, otherwise, they will not receive any reward for mining the block.

2. Remember to change conf.py

3. start the one has bootstrap host first.

# Sketches:

1. Include a transaction in block if its fee is higher than 0.1.

2. 1 tx per block and 1 minute per block

3. No tx time limit:

4. Model ends after 11-th block

5. 10 miners
11 users

6. Each user generates 1 transaction with transaction fees which follow uniform distribution

# Changes:

experiment1: network, txpool

# Tips

You should know that there are some differences between machines and computers as well as network environment. I have SPENT A LOT OF WEEKS dealing with the problems caused by these differences. It is really frustrated and I find sometimes a tiny difference may make some part in the code fail. However, the CODE DO WORK IN SOME ENVIRONMENT AND MACHINES. So if the code does not work on your computer, you should try to find the problem yourself. May be the network on your machine have some problem. Try the "ping" and use "telnet" to check that whether the the port 5678 and 5984 can be visited. And somehow change the code yourself to make it adapt to your environment when it is necessary.

Also, it is suggested that you should consider to use a machine with stable performence.

# 笔记

此版本解决了交易广播问题，并将数据库基础数据（创世区块和UTXO）上传为bctada.md文件。wallet.dat为钱包文件，用于收发数据。
recv函数通信接收的数据大小还是不够，还是出现"SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing"的错误，数据断了一半，所以把recv的参数再增加一倍。

更新了产生随机交易命令的程序(random_distributions.py && random_distribution2.py)。

更新了E1.md和E2.md里随机交易命令的数据。

数据库的线程安全又问题，尝试解决。

命令行会有重复输出一次的情况，尚不清楚原因。

解决了EOF的问题，就是接收到空数据b''.原因是server发送的信息直接等于"{"code": "0", "data": ""}"，要发送空信息应该用Msg的NONE_MSG才对。
